# Dynamic Path Planning Robot for Crowded Environments

## Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a robot capable of real-time dynamic path planning in crowded environments, such as airports, malls, or train stations. The robot will utilize advanced algorithms, sensor inputs, and predictive models to navigate from a starting point to a destination while avoiding collisions with both static and dynamic obstacles.

## Features
- **Real-time Navigation**: Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) for obstacle avoidance and efficient path planning.
- **Predictive Models**: Motion forecasting of dynamic obstacles using machine learning.
- **Simulation**: Realistic environment emulation in Gazebo.
- **Visualization**: Rviz integration for live data display, including paths and obstacle maps.

## Tools and Technologies
- **ROS 2 Navigation Stack (Nav2)**: Core navigation and path-planning framework.
- **Gazebo**: Simulated environment for testing.
- **Rviz**: Visualization of paths, maps, and obstacles.
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For developing predictive models.
- **Simulated Sensors**:
  - LiDAR: Obstacle detection and distance measurement.
  - RGB Camera: Visual input.
